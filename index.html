Interest in IT
We are in the information age. IT is at the heart of everything we do and integrated into every aspect of our lives. It helps us do our jobs better, it enables us to connect with family and friends, it permeates through our leisure time in the form of gaming and media, and we can use it to assist us in any part of daily life. 

For me specifically, my interest is in mobile technology. Almost every human being has a smart phone, and we use it to augment our daily life. These novel devices have become an extension of ourselves, to the point where most of us cannot go through a single day without one. Some may see this as dangerous, and there are certainly times when mobile use can be dangerous, such as when driving a vehicle or when operating heavy machinery. However, there are so many more areas in how mobile technology has improved our lives. It’s almost literally all the information in the world, on-demand, in the palm of our hands. Contributing to this area of technology is not simply about building applications, it can potentially have an immense effect on our daily lives.

My interest in IT started as a child. My uncle was working as a network engineer in the early 90s, and introduced us to our first computer. He bought us a tower, monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers, and installed it all for us. He showed me how to login, enter the password, and how to do simple things like navigate the desktop. Eventually he even helped us set up our dial-up internet connection. I spent so much time on the computer that I eventually became our family (including aunts, uncles, cousins) expert for anything IT related. From then on, I could see how affected we were by technology, and I knew that I wanted to do something later in life that could be a part of that. 

After high school, I studied a degree in computer science (unfinished) and then eventually landed an internship as a junior developer. From there, I decided to take a break from university to focus on my career, but never went back. I went on to develop for a few more years before transitioning into a post-sales role that required IT experience. I have since come to a point in my career where I have realised a degree will be incredibly valuable in my progression.






I have chosen to complete my studies at RMIT. I chose RMIT because it has a great reputation in the industry and has a great IT program. Their online studies allow me to continue working while studying part-time. I chose IT over computer science or software engineering because it has a broader scope in terms of how technology effects industry. It is more relevant to the work I am doing today, and I hope a structured approach to studying IT will broaden my horizons and provide added context to a lot of the experience I have acquired over the years.

Ideal Job
Senior Product Manager - https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/916235273/

Description: 
This is a senior product manager role at Canva. A product manager is a unique position that often works with the product owners/founders to determine the direction of a product. They work with various parts of the business, including engineering, design, sales, and marketing. This is a role that requires someone to set an overarching vision of a product initiative, and understanding that it takes a lot of people and a lot of moving pieces to make that happen. 

It appeals to me because it requires someone with experience in multiple areas. Developing a product requires people with different skills, and I see myself as someone who has a genuine interest and appreciation for all these different aspects and would love to have my hand at them. No two days would be the same as you would be working on different problems with different teams, or you could be working through larger problems that require the collaboration of multiple teams/departments.

Required Experience
A product manager is a position that requires many skills and does not have a clear path to get there. As this is a senior position, it would require years of experience as either a designer/software engineer/project manager. From there, it would also require someone to have already established their transition to a product management role, perhaps by working as a junior product manager and eventually working up to have a few years under their belt. The required qualifications could be a degree in IT, Engineering, Computer Science, or design. Often in these kinds of positions, qualifications can be overlooked if someone has the relevant professional experience mentioned above.

I have worked for a few years as a .NET developer and transitioned into a more sales/consultant orientated role. My current role allows me to work with founders to determine what resources they need for their product roadmap. This involves initial product discovery calls to determine design and tech stack, and then eventually putting together entire teams.

My professional experience has given me a high-level understanding of design, technology, sales, and marketing, but I lack the specific technical expertise required to be a senior product manager. I believe completing a degree in IT will give me a breadth of knowledge in different technologies and different aspects of IT. From there, I believe I would need to have a few more years as a software engineer under my belt before transitioning to a junior product management role. After 3-5 years as product manager, I believe I would then have the necessary experience to go for a senior product manager role, such as the one advertised at Canva.

Personal Profile:
Myers-Briggs Result: INFP-T Mediator (https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality)
Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.

Learning Style: Verbal (https://www.training.com.au/ed/which-learning-style-is-best-for-you-take-the-quiz/)
Verbal Learners are great with all things words – this includes both written and spoken. They take in information best when it is read, as well as if it is discussed verbally or listened to. Verbal Learners tend to make great writers and public speakers.

Gallup CliftonStrengths (https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252137/home.aspx):
1.	Restorative - People who are especially talented in the Restorative theme are adept at dealing with problems. They are good at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it.
2.	Connectedness - People who are especially talented in the Connectedness theme have faith in the links between all things. They believe there are few coincidences and that almost every event has a reason.
3.	Ideation - People who are especially talented in the Ideation theme are fascinated by ideas. They are able to find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena.
4.	Adaptability - People who are especially talented in the Adaptability theme prefer to “go with the flow.” They tend to be “now” people who take things as they come and discover the future one day at a time.
5.	Input - People who are especially talented in the Input theme have a craving to know more. Often they like to collect and archive all kinds of information.

These results are great and can often lead us to self-discoveries, however they are general indicators. We should not pigeon-hole ourselves into specific “types” as we may deprive ourselves of opportunities. Tests such as the ones above may provide us with a starting point and some direction, but we should still be open minded. My results seem to indicate that I would work well in a team with many diverse viewpoints, and that my skills may be beneficial in bringing different ideas together to work towards a common goal. When forming a team, I would be eager to work with people who bring different skills and different ideas in order to question my own assumptions and see new perspectives.









Project Idea – Frequent Flusher
Overview - This should be a summary of what the project will be. 

The project is a mobile application that will allow users to find nearby public bathrooms and bathrooms in shops and restaurants that are open to patrons. The application will list all nearby bathrooms and a overall cleanliness rating. Users will be also be able to rate bathrooms they visit and provide feedback. Owners of each bathroom will need to be verified and will be able to provide feedback by replying directly to users or giving bathroom updates such as “recently cleaned”. The application will be available on iOS and Android, as well as having an online portal for users and owners/councils.

Motivation - This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful. This may include statistics or other evidence, such as: "There service. are 1.5 billion cat owners in Australia, and so there is a huge market for an automated cat feeder. Using Raspberry Pi technology is a cheap and easily assembled solution to this problem." 

One of the biggest problems people have when they are out and about is finding a clean toilet. This application addresses several issues. Firstly, it allows users to find clean and hygenic bathrooms when they are out and about or travelling – both locals and tourists. This allows people to complete their business with peace of mind. It provides valuable information for those who are disabled or for mothers with young children. It motivates business owners to keep their establishment clean and creates extra foot traffic to generate business. Business owners can also market deals and special offers through the application to attract users and advertise their business. 

Description - Detailed description of the features of the product or service Tools 

User/patron application:
-	Signup: use email, gmail, or facebook. The application requires first name, last name, email, optional mobile number, agreement to T&C
-	Login: enter email and password, as well as optional TFA via text message.
-	GPS Map: The application will require access to location services and have google maps integration. Based on your current location the application will show all nearby toilets and bathrooms, represented by a small icon.
-	Bathroom icons: The icons will show a rating (e.g. 3.5), a business icon, and a glow around the icon to indicate there may be a special offering or deal. You can press the icon above each bathroom to show you additional information including the establishment name, rating out of 5, more details regarding the offer, and opening hours. There will also be an option to “navigate here” which will send the information to google maps for navigation. The icons will also allow you to favourite and share bathrooms via multiple channels (FB, Twitter, Insta, text, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc).
-	Feedback: On each icon for a bathroom, you will be able to see the current rating of the bathroom, how many ratings it has, comments from patrons, replies from the owner, and the time it was last cleaned as provided by the owner. There will be an option to provide feedback. The feedback option is initially greyed out and will only allow you to provide feedback if you have recently navigated to the bathroom (within the last hour). This is to prevent people from rating bathrooms without actually going there. 
-	Offers: Each icon could display an offer or deal by the owner of the shop/restaurant. In order to use the deal, you will need to claim it through the application and provide the verification code at the establishment. 
-	Profile: Each user will have access to their own profile which tracks metrics such as how many bathrooms they have navigated to, how many they have rated, how many deals they have claimed, and if they have received any replies to their feedback. Users can also view and edit their list of favourite bathrooms. The application also has standard functionality such as updating their details and deleting their account.
-	Add bathrooms to map: Users can also add bathrooms to maps which will be added to the application database pending verification.

Owner Application
-	Signup/login as Owner: An owner can register and must provide proof of business in order to verify. 
-	Updates: Owners will be able to update their opening hours as well provide the last update as to when they last cleaned the bathroom.
-	Offers: Owners can provide offers through the app and verify the offer codes of parons.
-	Metrics: Owners can track how many people have navigated to their bathroom, how many have provided ratings, how many people have viewed their bathroom, how many people have viewed their offers, and how many people have claimed their offers. They will also be able to view these metrics visually over time which can indicate performance, e,g growth or decline in use.
-	Feedback: Owners can respond to feedback or report feedback as inaccurate.


Technologies - The application will be built natively on both iOS and Android. The iOS application will be built using Swift, and the Android application will be built using Java. The application will have a Node.JS backend hosted on AWS. The website front-end will be built using React. The application will require integration with several services such as Facebook, Gmail, Google Maps, and potentially several Point Of Sale systems used by owners in order to track their deals.
